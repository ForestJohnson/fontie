# Fontie

The deamon that is running in the back of [Fontie](https://fontie.pixelsvsbytes.com). The backend
is where all the font conversion "magic" happens. The frontend is just an interface to upload the
font-files and trigger the genration of the font-package by the backend.

The Fontie backend is licensed as open source under the AGPL v3.

***Note:** Originally I wanted to refactor the code and write some documentation, but Iâ€™ve never found the
time to do so - sry for that. I'll add some extra documentation as soon as I find the time... I
really, really appreciate any clean-up/optimizing PRs from experienced Python/Fontforge developers
as this is my first python project. But also other PRs are nice, too :)*
